	<h1>Freepto development has been discontinued</h1>
	<p>During these years we developed Freepto with the main goal of providing a ready-to-use, encrypted OS to whoever was willing to abandon proprietary OS.</p>
	<p>For security reasons it is paramunt to keep Freepto always up-to-date. Unfortunately, this requires lot of time, and the current developer team is not able to keep up with it.</p>
	<p>Also, some choices we took 3 years ago now show up all their limits:<ul>
		<li>We considered that attacks such as malware were possible only in a limited number of cases and distinct from mass-surveilance techniques. It is now evident that we were wrong, and that advanced attacks are quite common</li>
		<li>We preferred not using Tor extensively, thinking that the slowness of such a network would be too much of a burden to our users; in the meanwhile, Tor got faster, while we reconsidered that usability need a broad project, capable of writing good documentation and develop carefully designed interfaces</li>
	</ul></p>
	<p>Therefore, we are ending Freepto development.</p>
	<p>We suggest to Freepto users to give a try to Tails, a live OS focused on privacy and anonimity. Read more on Tails website: <a href="https://tails.boum.org/">https://tails.boum.org/</a></p>

                    <p>Freepto is a Linux-based operating system on USB stick. This means
                        you can bring it with you and use any computer as it was your own. Also,
                        data you save on the USB stick will always automatically be encrypted (i.e.
                        nobody else will be able to access them).</p>
                    <p>The idea behind Freepto is to offer an <em>easy</em> way to deal with the most common
                        needs of activists, without giving up the <em>convenience</em> of a traditional operating system.</p>

                    <p>Just plug your USB stick into your computer, then switch it on, <a href="https://we.riseup.net/freepto-wiki/freepto-docs#come-avvio-freepto">select the USB boot</a>, and you're done.</p>
